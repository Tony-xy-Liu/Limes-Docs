Prerequisites
"""""""""""""
A `sample type <https://www.elabjournal.com/doc/AddingSampleTypes.html>`_
must exist in eLab for each type of sample encountered.

    A *type* refers to a group of samples with a unique set
    of descriptors. For example, all saanich samples may require depth and
    date of collection, while all fosmid samples may require details on gene content.
    Since depth and date are a different set of descriptors than gene content, consider
    creating a *Saanich Depth Sample* type and a *Fosmid Sample* type.

A `label template <https://elab.msl.ubc.ca/members/protocol/?protID=40950>`_
must exist for each style of label to be printed.

Steps
""""""

|disclaimer|

1. Record environmental samples in eLab staging area (a)
2. Label orignal samples (b)
3. Filter
4. Record filters in eLab staging area (a)
5. Label filters (b)
6. Transfer and aliquot from filters
7. Record aliquots in eLab staging area (a)
8. Label aliquots (b)
9. Move all samples from the staging area to their final locations
10. Transfer all the physical samples to their final storage location
